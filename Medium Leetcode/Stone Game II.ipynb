    "**Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i]. The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.\n",
    "\n",
    "On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M. Then, we set M = max(M, X). Initially, M = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game continues until all the stones have been taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]\n",
    "\n",

    "I think that this problem can be solved with a dynamic programming problem where at each step, look at the maximum stones the current player can collect from `index` with current `M`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem also seems to be a zero-sum game where Alice's gain is Bob's loss and vice versa. \n",
    "Hence, a valid solution would be trying to minimize Bob's gain to maximize Alice's win. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I tried to model the dp state as: dp[i, M] = max number of stones from piles[:i] with current M. \n",
    "There are two variables in the dp state as the condition we are trying to look for depends on two variables. "
